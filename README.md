# Speed-Breaker-Detection-Using-Hilbert-Transform


This MATLAB project is designed to detect speed breakers by analyzing vehicle vibration data using the Hilbert transform. By processing vibration signals with the Hilbert transform, this method enables precise identification and characterization of road irregularities such as speed breakers.
