# Speed-Breaker-Detection-Using-Hilbert-Transform


This MATLAB project is designed to detect speed breakers by analyzing vehicle vibration data using the Hilbert transform. By processing vibration signals with the Hilbert transform, this method enables precise identification and characterization of road irregularities such as speed breakers.

Key Components
1.	Data Acquisition: Collect vibration signals from the vehicle’s sensors or accelerometers.
2.	Hilbert Transform Application: Utilize MATLAB’s built-in functions to apply the Hilbert transform and extract features from the vibration signals.
3.	Detection Algorithm: Implement an algorithm to detect speed breakers based on the features derived from the Hilbert transform.
Installation and Setup
MATLAB:
1)	Ensure you have MATLAB installed (version 2018b or later is recommended).
Dependencies:
1)No additional toolboxes are required beyond MATLAB’s standard library.
Setup:
1)Download or clone the repository containing the MATLAB scripts.
2)Place the scripts and your data files in a working directory.
Usage
1)Prepare Data:
2)Ensure that your vibration data is in a supported format (e.g., .mat, .csv).
3)Load your data into MATLAB. You can use functions like readmatrix, load, or similar.
Run the Analysis:
1)Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the scripts.
2)Execute the main script (e.g., speed_breaker_detection.m) by typing:
3)The script will process the vibration data, apply the Hilbert transform, and display the results.
Visualize Results:
1)The script may generate plots and visualizations of the detected speed breakers and vibration features.
